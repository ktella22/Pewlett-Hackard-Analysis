# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
In this module analysis, we created two tables. The first one is to determine the number of retiring employees based on their titles and the second one is to identify the employess who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. In the first part, we included employee number, their first name and last name, title of the employement, start and end of hiring date. For the mentorship program tables, we added the employee number, their first and last name, birth date, employement start and end date and their position titles.  

## Results
Below is the retirement_titles files. The table determines the retiring employee according to their title status.

The second table shows the lists of employee who are eligible to participate in mentorship program. The table can be seen in the file below: 
[mentorship_eligibility.csv](https://github.com/ktella22/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/files/7698262/mentorship_eligibility.csv)

Based on the analysis from two above tables, there are four major points that can be delivered. 
- According to the retiring_titles table, a third of the retiring employees are Senior Engineer role followed by the Senior Staff members who are the other third of retiring employess in the list. 
- For that reason, the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff roles are the two priority roles to fill in when it comes to hiring plan. 
- Among the employee who are retiring, there are only 1549 employees who are eligible to participate in mentorship program. 
- However, the total number of retiring are ~80% more than the people who are in the mentorship program. In order to do so, the company needs to come up with the plan that can cover for the difference between the number who are retiring and the potential employees who can be filled in for those postions.
